## 4. How Transcription Works

After upload, your note follows these steps:

4. **Ready** (you can read transcript + summary)

If something fails, status becomes **Failed** and you can retry.

## 5. How Summarization Works

- Once transcription is complete, AI reads your transcript.
- It generates a concise summary.
- In some flows, translation may also be available.
- Final result is saved in your note.

---

## 6. Organize Your Notes

## 6.1 Using Projects
- Create projects to group notes by theme (e.g., “Client A”, “Ideas”, “Meetings”).
- Assign each note to a project.
- Reassign anytime.

## 6.2 Using Tags
- Create tags (e.g., `urgent`, `marketing`, `podcast`).
- Add one or several tags per note.
- Use tags to filter notes quickly.

---

## 7. Search and Filters

You can find notes faster by combining:
- Keyword search (text, transcript, summary)
- Project filter
- Tag filter
- Date range filter

Tip: Start with keyword + project, then add tags/date for precise results.

Common reasons:

Use **Retry** after checking the file.

Passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text.
